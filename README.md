### ðŸ“– About me

A Tech enthusiast and builder with a unique foundation in **Mechanical Engineering** and hands-on expertise in **software development, data engineering, and robotics.** I love diving into complex problemsâ€”from taking apart toys as a child and working out mathematical formulas to creating robust software solutions that really work.

My journey has been filled with exciting projects like building my own programming language ("Rudito") in Python and creating real-time IoT devices that you can control remotely. I've also had a blast working on robotics projects for competitions! Currently, I'm putting my skills to work as a **Data Engineer** in Berlin, where I develop cool tools like fuzzy matching systems. I'm genuinely fascinated by how things work, whether they're physical objects or computational systems, and I'm always looking for new ways to create technology that makes a difference.
